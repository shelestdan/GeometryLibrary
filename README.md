Write a library in C# for delivery to external customers that can calculate the area of a circle by radius and a triangle on three sides. In addition to performance, we will evaluate:

Unit tests

Ease of adding other shapes

Calculating the area of a shape without knowing the type of shape in compile-time

Checking whether the triangle is rectangular
